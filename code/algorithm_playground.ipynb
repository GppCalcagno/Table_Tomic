    "# Table Football Rating Adjustment System\n",
    "\n",
    "This document explains the methodology behind a rating update system for table football matches. The system adjusts individual player ratings (scaled from 0 to 10) based on match outcomes and individual performance relative to the team average.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Team Average Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each team, compute the **team average rating** using the ratings of the goalkeeper and attacker:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TeamAvg} = \\frac{\\text{Rating}_{\\text{goalkeeper}} + \\text{Rating}_{\\text{attacker}}}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If Team A has:  \n",
    "- Goalkeeper rating: 2.0  \n",
    "- Attacker rating: 7.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TeamA\\_Avg} = \\frac{2.0 + 7.0}{2} = 4.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Expected Outcome Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the team average ratings, calculate the **expected win probability** for each team with a logistic function (similar to the Elo rating system).\n",
    "\n",
    "For Team A:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_A = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{\\frac{R_B - R_A}{d}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( R_A \\) and \\( R_B \\) are the average ratings for Team A and Team B.\n",
    "- \\( d \\) is a scaling factor adjusting the sensitivity to rating differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Team B, the expected outcome is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_B = 1 - E_A\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Actual Match Outcome and Goal Margin\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actual Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the actual match outcome (\\(S\\)) from the scores:\n",
    "- **Win:** \\( S = 1 \\)\n",
    "- **Loss:** \\( S = 0 \\)\n",
    "- **Tie:** \\( S = 0.5 \\) for both teams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the **goal difference**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Goal Difference} = |\\text{score}_A - \\text{score}_B|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Margin Multiplier\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute the **margin multiplier (M)** using the logarithm of the goal difference plus one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M = \\ln(\\text{Goal Difference} + 1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This logarithmic function dampens the impact of large goal differences. For a tie ((\\text{Goal Difference} = 0\\)), set \\( M = 1 \\) to avoid a zero multiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Team-Level Rating Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate a **base rating change** for the entire team:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta R_{\\text{team}} = K \\times M \\times (S - E)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( K \\) is a constant that controls the maximum rating change.\n",
    "- \\( M \\) is the margin multiplier.\n",
    "- \\( S \\) is the actual match outcome.\n",
    "- \\( E \\) is the expected win probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Individual Rating Adjustment\n",
    "\n",
    "To reflect differences among team members, adjust the team delta for each player based on the difference between their individual rating and the team average.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1. Adjustment Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate an **adjustment factor** for each player:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Adjustment Factor} = 1 + \\beta \\times (\\text{TeamAvg} - \\text{PlayerRating})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\\( \\beta \\)** is a tuning parameter controlling the sensitivity of the adjustment.\n",
    "- If a player's rating is **below** the team average (\\(\\text{TeamAvg} - \\text{PlayerRating} > 0\\)), the factor is **greater than 1**. On a winning team, this player gains more points.\n",
    "- Conversely, if a player's rating is **above** the team average, the factor is less than 1 (or more negative on a losing team), causing a larger point loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2. Role Weight and Rating Update\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player's new rating is updated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{NewRating} = \\text{OldRating} + \\Delta R_{\\text{team}} \\times \\text{Adjustment Factor} \\times w_{\\text{role}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( w_{\\text{role}} \\) is a weight factor specific to the player's role (e.g., goalkeeper or attacker).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3. Clipping the Rating\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the updated rating stays within the 0 to 10 range:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{NewRating} = \\max(0, \\min(10, \\text{NewRating}))\n",
